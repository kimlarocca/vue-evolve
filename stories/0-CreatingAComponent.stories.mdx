# Creating A Component

This document lays out step by step guidelines and best practices for creating Vue components. Taking a consistent approach to components will make the design system easier to learn and use.

## Naming Components

Our component names follow the Vue Styleguide [https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/). Component names should always be PascalCase and multi-word (this prevents conflicts with existing and future HTML elements, since all HTML elements are a single word).

* Base components or those with single word names should be prefixed with a V (e.g., VButton).
* Components that should only ever have a single active instance should begin with the The prefix, to denote that there can be only one per page (e.g., TheFooter).
* Child components that are tightly coupled with their parent should include the parent component name as a prefix (e.g., SegmentList and SegmentListItem).

| Filename | Component Syntax |
|---|---|
| VButton               |   `<v-button />`               |
| TheFooter      |   `<the-footer />`     |
| SegmentList  |   `<segment-list />` |
| SegmentListItem  |   `<segment-list-item />` |

## Creating the component skeleton

If you're starting from scratch, you want to create a basic component skeleton. If you're refactoring an existing component you can skip this step and work with a copy of that component instead.

Here is a basic skeleton for a Vue single file component:

```
<template>
    <div>Your markup goes here!</div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'Component Name'
}
</script>

<style lang="scss">
// add some styles here!
</style>
```

## Create stories in Storybook

Storybook allows you to prototype and build out your component with multiple variations visible while you work.

Stories can be written in javascript or in blocks of code that go directly into your MDX documentation:

```
import { Meta, Canvas, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';
import VCounter from '../../../src/components/VCounter'

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Photos">
        {{
            components: { VCounter },
            template: `<v-counter icon="gallery" text="Photos" value="40" href="http://www.google.com"/>`
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
```

If you need to mock larger data structures in your stories you can use a data object. When a Vue instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its data object to Vue’s reactivity system. When the values of those properties change, the view will “react”, updating to match the new values.

```
<Canvas>
    <Story name="All">
        {{
            components: { ArticleMetadata, VCounter, VByline },
            data () {
                return {
                    authors: [
                        {
                            firstName: 'Jen',
                            lastName: 'Chung',
                            organization: 'Gothamist',
                            organizationUrl: 'http://www.gothamist.com'
                        },
                        {
                            firstName: 'Brian',
                            lastName: 'Lehrer',
                            url: 'http://www.google.com',
                        }
                        ,
                        {
                            firstName: 'Shumita',
                            lastName: 'Basu',
                            url: 'http://www.google.com',
                            organization: 'WNYC',
                            organizationUrl: 'http://www.wnyc.org'
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            template: `
                        <article-metadata
                            publish-date="Jan 1, 2020 1:25PM"
                            updated-date="Mar 2, 2020 10:08AM"
                        >
                            <template v-slot:authors><v-byline :authors="authors" /></template>
                            <template v-slot:comments><v-counter icon="comment" text="Comments" value="40" href="http://www.google.com"/></template>
                            <template v-slot:photos><v-counter icon="gallery" text="Photos" value="40" href="http://www.google.com"/></template>
                        </article-metadata>
                      `
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
```

# Writing your component code

We use Single File Components (SFCs) in our design system. SFCs like the skeleton example above are components that are self-contained in their own files.

[Learn more about Vue Single File Comoponents](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html)

## Starting your local development servers

Start Storybook:

```
npm run storybook
```

Go to Storybook in your browser and navigate to the stories you created. Now you can go back to your component file in your editor of choice. As you update your component's code, its stories will update live in Storybook.

## Styles

Each component's styles should live within its component file. For example, button styles should be defined in the style block of the VButton.vue file.

Every element should have a class. This allows for easier targeting, not just in your stylesheets and themes, but also in automated testing and analytics tools.
```
<template>
  <a
    class="button"
  >
    <slot />
    <span
      v-if="label"
      class="button-label"
    >
      {{ label }}
    </span>
  </a>
</template>
```

## CSS Variables

Use *css variables* to define style values where possible.

```
.button {}
  padding: var(--space-1) var(--space-4);
  color: rgb(var(--color-button-text));
  background-color: rgb(var(--color-button));
}
```

## Optional properties

Sometimes a component has properties that are optional, such as an icon or secondary title. Use v-if to hide the elements that display these properties when they don't exist.

```
<div
  v-if="details"
  class="card-details"
>
    {{details}}
</div>
```

## States

 Certain states on a component might affect how it's displayed, for example to show the "playing" or "active" state on our stream switcher card. Use code to conditionally provide CSS classes that indicates these states as hooks for styling.

```
<div
    class="audio-player"
    :class="{'is-active':active, 'is-playing':playing}"
>
```

## Events

We can use the v-on directive to listen to DOM events and run some JavaScript when they’re triggered.

For example, the VAccordion component runs the open() method when you click on the accordion header:

```
<div
  :id="id"
  class="accordion-header"
  :class="{'accordion-header-active': visible}"
  role="button"
  tabindex="0"
  @click="open"
  @keypress.enter.space.prevent="open"
>
```

Here is the corresponding open() method:
```
methods: {
    open () {
      this.active = !this.visible
    }
}
```

# Vue Evolve

Vue Evolve is a design system built with Storybook and Vue.

A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product. Feel free to explore all of the materials you find here.

#### Installation

```
npm install vue-evolve --save-dev
```

Import the vue-evolve main style sheet in your application:

```
@import "~vue-evolve/src/assets/scss/main";
```

#### Nuxt Configuration

Add this to your nuxt.config.js file to import components for use with SSR:

```
build: {
  transpile: ['vue-evolve']
}
```

#### Theming

Vue Evolve uses CSS variables that allow us to style components in a way that's consistent and flexible. We also maintain both a light (default) mode and dark mode for our components.

Copy the settings.scss file into your application to customize Vue Evolve to match your theme. Create override files as needed for further customization!

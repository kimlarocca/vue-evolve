# Vue Evolve

Vue Evolve is a design system built with Storybook and Vue.

#### Installation

```
npm install vue-evolve --save-dev
```

Import the vue-evolve main style sheet in your application:

```
@import "~vue-evolve/src/assets/scss/main";
```

#### Nuxt Configuration

Add this to your nuxt.config.js file to import components for use with SSR:

```
build: {
  transpile: ['vue-evolve']
}
```

#### Theming

Vue Evolve uses CSS variables to style components, and we also maintain light and dark modes for our components.

Copy the settings.scss file into your application to customize Vue Evolve to match your theme. Create override files as needed for further customization!

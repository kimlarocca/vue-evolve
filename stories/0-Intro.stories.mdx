# Vue Evolve

Vue Evolve is a design system built with Storybook and Vue.

A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product. Feel free to explore all of the materials you find here.

#### Installation

`npm install vue-evolve` to pull them in to your web client's vue app.

In your web client's main scss file, import vue-evolve's styles:

```
@import "~vue-evolve/src/assets/scss/main";
```

#### Theming

Evolve uses CSS variables that allow us to style components in a way that's consistent and flexible.

Copy the settings.scss file into your web client to customize vue-evolve to match your theme.

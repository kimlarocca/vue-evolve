# Using NPM Link

NPM Link is used to link project dependencies together locally without having to publish them.

#### Setup

Create a global symlink for this package (run this in the vue-evolve project):

```
npm link (or sudo npm link)
```

Tell your application to use the global symlink (run this in your web client project):

```
npm link vue-evolve
```

Your web client should automatically refresh with changes, but you may need to update it after components are changed by running:

```
npm update
```

Unlink your web client or vue-evolve:

```
npm unlink
```
